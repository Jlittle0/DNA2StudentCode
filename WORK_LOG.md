| October 9  | 12:45-1:15pm  |                                                                                                                              Started ideating on how to approach this problem. Thought of a couple ideas, but so far the best has been to run through the entire sequence, check for the first instance of the first character, then check if the last character for our given string is in the correct, spot, and if it is, then add the array of the first letter to a map. Afterwards, use that map to search through a much smaller sequence to find longest # of repeats. |
| October 11 | 11:00 - 11:55 | Worked on converting the STR into a unique integer number quickly and ideating on solutions of how to solve the overall problem. With the hints from Mr. Blick I now think I can implement my idea at a faster speed, but still not fully sure if I'm going to use it yet. Will most likely write something up quickly just to benchmark current speed then make more changes along the way as time allows. Also learned how to use bitshifting, though I wasn't able to implement it in the way I wanted and only used it to save time instead of running Math.pow() I think. |
