Thought of a couple ideas, but so far the best has been to run through the entire sequence, check for the first instance of the first character, then check if the last character for our given string is in the correct, spot, and if it is, then add the array of the first letter to a map. Afterwards, use that map to search through a much smaller sequence to find longest # of repeats. |

With the hints from Mr. Blick I now think I can implement my idea at a faster speed, but still not fully sure if I'm going to use it yet. Will most likely write something up quickly just to benchmark current speed then make more changes along the way as time allows. Also learned how to use bitshifting, though I wasn't able to implement it in the way I wanted and only used it to save time instead of running Math.pow() I think. |
| October 14th | 4:45 - 6:00pm | Started working on finding the longest consecutive occurences by reading through my occurences arraylist. I managed to complete this and get the program working by first essentially finding the next closest occurence that's either the correct length or further than the correct length for our sequence, then if it was equal to the set distance (STR.length()) that I wanted, I would say that that occurence had now been visited to prevent overlaps in the future, and I increased count by 1 and repeated. Did this for each individual occurence, until there were either none left that hadn't been checked already, or it was no longer possible for a longer occurence to appear. All tests work in a fairly quick amount of time and I'm happy that it managed to work out finally. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Also removed calls of the pow function etc. that I used to find the number required to cut off the first digit of a given integer and instead just set that as a constant based on the length of the STR provided removing a lot of unncessary, extremely slow calculations. Had to slightly change the hash function so that none of the letters were equal to 4 because then there would be radix problems since they would be the same number. |
